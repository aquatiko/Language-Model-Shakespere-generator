# Language-Model-Shakespere-generator
This is project based on Natural Language generation where the user gives a starting sentence and the model predicts(completes) the rest of the sentence. 

This has been trained on a sonnet written by Shakespere using LSTMs and applying a character level language generator.

As currrent state of the art techniques related to this topic are still in beggining stages but experimenting with different sequence lengths, length of 100 seems to be giving better result as a character based model for this particular corpus.
